Explanation of the code:-

Challenge 0:-
Challenge 0 is to build an API.
For that, I had created three Golang files named aven.go,mutant.go and antihero.go to build RESTful API's.
On executing these Golang files, API's are build which gives a list of character and its power level.
Condition is that power level has to change for every 10 sec interval so that I have used Golang Tickers and math Random numbers.
On using Tickers, the value changes for every 10 secs interval and that value is also a random number between 0 to 100.
I had solved Challenge 0 and need to learn more about microservices in order to work with Challenge 1 and Challenge 2.
I am working with gRPC microservice and it is not completed. Once it is completed I will start working with Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 and try to complete it as soon as possible.
