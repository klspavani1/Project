Explanation of the code:-

Challenge 0:-
Challenge 0 is to build an API.

I had created three go files within the same package API to call them parallelly in the client.go program which is basic requirement.
I had created the function called getpowerlevel and the argument is name which has to be given as the command line argument in client.go program.
Then the program will return the exact power level of the required name.
For this, I had used microservice concept of model,service and business class.
